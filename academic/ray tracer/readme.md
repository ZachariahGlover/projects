This is a ray tracer that I wrote for the fourth year computer graphics course at UTSC.  
I implemented the Phong reflection model for lighting, both point and area light sources, antialiasing, depth of field, transparency (with refraction), bounding volumes and texture mapping.  
Here are some demo images.  
Depth of field:
