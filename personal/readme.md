## Personal projects
I've categorized my personal projects by language/platform/purpose (whichever I decided was a more prominent feature of the project).
Arduino contains the code files for any completed projects involving me tinkering with an [arduino microcontroller](https://www.arduino.cc/).
Challenge contains the code that I wrote for completing various coding challenges such as [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
CPP is for projects that I worked on to learn c++ or c++ libraries.
Unity is for projects that involve the (Unity)[https://unity3d.com/] game engine.
