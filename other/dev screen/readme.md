## Hello!
I've bundled both projects into one app.  
Running this is fairly simple, I've bundled all the necessary frameworks with the app.  
  
Use the command 'node server.js' to run the server.  
In a browser you can use the app by navigating to 'localhost:41337'  
(I've set the port that the server uses as 41337, this can be changed in server.js, and will require navigating to a different url to reflect the change).
